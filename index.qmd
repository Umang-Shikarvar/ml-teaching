# Comprehensive Machine Learning Resources

Welcome to a complete collection of machine learning course materials developed at IIT Gandhinagar. This resource combines theoretical foundations with practical implementations, designed for both students and instructors.

## 🎯 What You'll Find Here

### [📊 Interactive Notebooks](notebooks.qmd)
Over 100 Jupyter notebooks with hands-on coding examples, from basics to advanced topics. All notebooks are runnable in Google Colab.

### [📚 Lecture Slides](slides.qmd)
Comprehensive slide decks covering all major machine learning topics, organized by category for easy navigation.

### 🔧 Practical Applications
Real-world examples using datasets like MNIST, Iris, and custom problems across computer vision, NLP, and more.

## 🏗️ Course Structure

The materials are organized into six main categories:

- **Basics & Foundations** - Getting started with ML concepts
- **Mathematical Foundations** - Linear algebra, optimization, probability
- **Supervised Learning** - Regression, classification, model evaluation
- **Neural Networks** - Deep learning fundamentals and architectures
- **Advanced Topics** - Time series, reinforcement learning, modern techniques
- **Unsupervised Learning** - Clustering, dimensionality reduction

## 🚀 Getting Started
