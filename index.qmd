## Course Overview

This comprehensive machine learning course provides a solid foundation in both theoretical concepts and practical applications. Students will learn to implement algorithms from scratch and apply state-of-the-art techniques to real-world problems.

### What You'll Learn

- **Supervised Learning**: Linear/logistic regression, decision trees, SVMs, neural networks
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering, dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection  
- **Model Evaluation**: Cross-validation, bias-variance tradeoff, performance metrics
- **Advanced Topics**: Ensemble methods, regularization, feature engineering
- **Practical Skills**: Python implementation, data preprocessing, model deployment
